1. What is Data and Analytics mean.
    Data
        data is individual pieces of factual information recorded 
        and used for the purpose of analysis
    Features
        an individual measurable property(column) or
        characteristic of a phenomenon/event
        *not all feature are matter, based on business needs
    Analytics
        process of discovering, interpreting, and communicating significant patterns in data. 
        Analytics help us to see insights and meaningful data that remains undetected
    Type of Analytics
        a.  Descriptive Analytics
            Answers the “what happened” by
            summarizing past data, usually in the form of
            dashboards. Track KPI.
        b.  Diagnostic Analytics
            Answers the “why did it happened” by
            drills down to find the pattern of insight
            from descriptive analytics. 
        c.  Predictive Analytics
            Answers the “what is likely to
            happen” by utilize the previous data
            to make a prediction about the future outcomes
            *Often to use a statistical approach, rule-based, and machine learning.
        d.  Prescriptive Analytics
            Answers the “what do I need to do”
            by compose the best action and
            recommendation from the predictive
            analytics. 
        *complexity and value increase for each type
2. Manipulating data
    Joining data
        VLOOKUP in Google Spreadsheets 
            Formula: 
                =VLOOKUP(search_key, range, index, [is_sorted])
                =VLOOKUP($B2,'Customers Sheet'!A:B,2,0)
            details:
                Search Key = is the value that will be search in given range (current sheets)
                Range = is the area of search key will be search (another sheets)
                Index = is returned value from a selected area in range (another sheets).
                        column 1 is index 1
                Is sorted = TRUE(1), FALSE(0)
    Cleaning data
    Transforming data for ML model
3. The fundamental of statistics.
    Overview
        statistic help you:
        ● use the proper methods to collect the data,
        ● employ the correct analyses, and
        ● effectively present the results
    Data Type
        Categorical Data type
            Nominal
                for labeling/naming the variables.
                E.g. hair color, months name (jan, feb,...), gender, marital status, etc.
            Ordinal
                shows where is a number is in order in a sequence format.
                E.g. class rank(first, second, third), reviews rating(1-5), grades(A,B,C), etc.
        Numerical Data type
            Discrete
                count that involves only integers
                E.g. the number of student in a class
            Continue
                could be meaningfully divided into finer levels
                E.g. the average height of the student in a class
    Type of statistic
        Descriptive
            summarize the characteristics of data by collecting the chosen sample from 
            the population and describe it using of its "central tendency" and "variability"
            > measure of central tendency
                - mean (rata-rata)
                    spreadsheets: MODE(value1, [value2, ...])
                - median (nilai tengah)
                    spreadsheets: MEDIAN(valueø, [valueù, ...])
                - mode (modus)
                    spreadsheets: AVERAGE(valueø, [valueù, ...])
            > measure in variability
                - range (jangkauan)
                    spreadsheets:
                        substract Max() and Min() function
                        MAX(value1, [value2, …]) - MIN(value1,[value2, …])
                - variance
                    SD without squared
                    spreadsheets: VAR(value1, [value2, …])
                - standard deviation(SD)
                    SD is to measure how disperse the data are to the mean.
                    deviation is the distance between an observed value and the mean value. 
                    squared to tackle negative number and ambiguity
                    *low SD (approaching zero) = data are clustered around the mean
                    *high SD (leaving zero) = data are more spreadout
                    spreadsheets: STDEV(value1, [value2, …])
        Inferential
            to make an “Inference” or “Prediction” by using the chosen
                sample to make generalizations about a population.
            main focus:
                - estimating the parameter
                - hypothesis testing
    Probability
        Overview
            Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur in a Random Experiment.
            quantified as a number between 0 (impossibility) and 1 (certainty). 
        Probability distribution
            tells you what is all the probability of an event looks like.
            example
                two standard six-sided dice
                    6 * 6 = 36
                    number 7 appearance = (1+6, 6+1, 5+2, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3) = 6
                    possibility = 6/36 = 1/6
    Shape of distribution
        Skewness
            skewness is a degree of asymmetry observed in a probability distribution 
            that deviates from the symmetrical normal distribution (bell curve) 
            bell curve is mean=median=mode
            note:
                if skewness 
                    < -1 = highly negative skewed
                    > 1 = highly positive skewed
                if skewness 
                    between -1 and -0.5 = moderately negative skewed
                    between 0.5 and 1 = moderately positive skewed
                if skewness between -0.5 and 0.5 = approx symmetrical (bell curve)
            spreadsheets:
                SKEW(value1, [value2, …])
        Kurtosis
            Kurtosis refers to the degree of presence of outliers in the distribution. 
            for masuring data is heavy-tailed or light-tailed in a normal distribution.
            type:
                leptokurtic (heavy-tailed distribution)
                    positive kurtosis, kurt > 0
                mesokurtic
                    same as normal distribution, kurt = 0
                platykurtic (light tailed distribution)
                    negative  kurtosis, kurt < 0
            application:
                in finance kurtosis is used as a measure of financial risk
                leptocurtic = high level of risk for an investment
                    because high probabilities for extremely large and extremely small returns
                platykurtic = moderate level of risk
                    because extreme returns are relatively low and more dispersed distribution
            spreadsheets:
                KURT(value1, value2, …)
    Probability distribution
        a. Normal Distribution
            Height of People and IQ Scores
        b. Binomial Distribution
            Win/lose the lottery ticket (multiple trial)
        c. Poisson Distribution
            The number of thefts reported in an area on a day.
        d. Uniform Distribution
            Rolling a single dice (equally distributed)
        e. Bernoulli Distribution
            A student will pass or fail an exam (single trial)
        f. Exponential Distribution
            The human life expectancy (if the
            human are a smoker, its likely to have a shorter life expectancy
            depending on the severity).
4. Overview of data visualization in Google Spreadsheets.
    Bar chart
        for comparison between the categorical and numerical value
    Line chart
        display a quantitative data both discrete and continuous random
        variable within continuous time period.
    Histogram
         to know your data distribution within an interval.
    Scatter plot
         to know the correlation or relationship between dependent and
        independent variables placed in a cartesian coordinates.
